                <p>He was born in 1907 in Eğridere township (now Ardino in southern Bulgaria) of the Sanjak
                    of Gümülcine (now Komotini in northern Greece), in the Ottoman Empire. His father was an Ottoman
                    officer, Selahattin Ali, and his mother Husniye. His father's family was from Of in Black Sea
                    region. He lived in Istanbul, Çanakkale and Edremit before he entered the Teacher School in
                    Balıkesir. His elementary and middle school education was interrupted by WWI and had a very
                    difficult childhood. Then he was transferred from Balikesir to the School of Education in Istanbul,
                    where he graduated in 1926 with teacher's certificate. His various poems and short stories were
                    published in school student paper. After serving as a teacher in Yozgat for one year, he earned a
                    fellowship from the Ministry of National Education and studied in Potsdam, Germany from 1928 to
                    1930. When he returned to Turkey, he taught German language in high schools at Aydın and Konya.</p>

                <p>While he was serving as a teacher in Konya, he was arrested for a poem he wrote
                    criticizing Atatürk's policies, and accused of libelling two other journalists. Having served his
                    sentence for several months in Konya and then in the Sinop Fortress Prison, he was released in 1933
                    in an amnesty granted to mark the 10th anniversary of the declaration of the Republic of Turkey. He
                    then applied to the Ministry of National Education for permission to teach again. After proving his
                    allegiance to Atatürk by writing the poem "Benim Aşkım" (literally: My Love or My Passion), he was
                    assigned to the publications division at the Ministry of National Education. Sabahattin Ali married
                    Aliye on May 16, 1935 and had a daughter, Filiz. He did his military service in 1936. He was called
                    back to military service twice during WWII, like most Turkish adult males at the time. He was
                    imprisoned again and released in 1944. He also owned and edited a popular weekly newspaper called
                    "Marko Paşa" (pronounced "Marco Pasha"), together with Aziz Nesin.

                <p>Upon his release from prison, he suffered financial troubles. His application for a
                    passport was denied. Because of the danger for being imprisoned again while attempting to escape to
                    Germany, he was killed at the Bulgarian border, probably on 1 or 2 April 1948. His body was found on
                    June 16, 1948. It is generally believed that he was killed by Ali Ertekin, a smuggler with
                    connections to the National Security Service, who had been paid to help him pass the border. Another
                    hypothesis is that Ertekin handed him over to the security services, and he was killed during
                    interrogation. It is believed that he was ultimately killed by the Turkish Government because of his
                    political opinions. Sabahattin Ali's 100th birth anniversary was celebrated in Bulgarian city Ardino
                    in March 31, 2007. Ali is a well-known author in this country because his books have been read in
                    schools in Bulgaria since the 1950s.<br> For further information about the author's life visit <a
